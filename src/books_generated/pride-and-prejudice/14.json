  "DURING dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants\n    were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his\n    guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to\n    shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness.",
  "Lady\n    Catherine de Bourgh’s attention to his wishes, and consideration for his\n    comfort, appeared very remarkable.",
  "Mr. Bennet could not have chosen\n    better.",
  "Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise.",
  "The subject elevated him\n    to more than usual solemnity of manner; and with a most important aspect\n    he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a\n    person of rank—such affability and condescension, as he had himself\n    experienced from Lady Catherine.",
  "She had been graciously pleased to\n    approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of\n    preaching before her.",
  "She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,\n    and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of\n    quadrille in the evening.",
  "Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many\n    people, he knew, but he had never seen anything but affability in her.\n    ",
  "She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she\n    made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the\n    neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or\n    two to visit his relations.",
  "She had even condescended to advise him to\n    marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had\n    once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly\n    approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed\n    to suggest some herself,—some shelves in the closets upstairs.",
  "“That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,” said Mrs. Bennet, “and I\n    dare say she is a very agreeable woman.",
  "It is a pity that great ladies\n    in general are not more like her.",
  "Does she live near you, sir?”",
  "“The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane\n    from Rosings Park, her Ladyship’s residence.”",
  "“I think you said she was a widow, sir?",
  "has she any family?”",
  "“She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very\n    extensive property.”",
  "“Ah,” cried Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, “then she is better off than\n    many girls.",
  "And what sort of young lady is she?",
  "Is she handsome?”",
  "“She is a most charming young lady, indeed.",
  "Lady Catherine herself says\n    that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the\n    handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks\n    the young woman of distinguished birth.",
  "She is unfortunately of a sickly\n    constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many\n    accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of, as I am\n    informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still\n    resides with them.",
  "But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends\n    to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.”",
  "“Has she been presented?",
  "I do not remember her name among the ladies at\n    court.”",
  "“Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;\n    and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived\n    the British Court of its brightest ornament.",
  "Her Ladyship seemed pleased\n    with the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to\n    offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to\n    ladies.",
  "I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her\n    charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess; and that the most\n    elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by\n    her.",
  "These are the kind of little things which please her Ladyship, and\n    it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to\n    pay.”",
  "“You judge very properly,” said Mr. Bennet; “and it is happy for you\n    that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy.",
  "May I ask\n    whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the\n    moment, or are the result of previous study?”",
  "“They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time; and though I\n    sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant\n    compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to\n    give them as unstudied an air as possible.”",
  "Mr. Bennet’s expectations were fully answered.",
  "His cousin was as absurd\n    as he had hoped; and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,\n    maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,\n    and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner\n    in his pleasure.",
  "By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad\n    to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over,\n    glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies.",
  "Mr. Collins readily assented, and a book\n    was produced; but on beholding it (for everything announced it to be\n    from a circulating library)",
  "he started back, and, begging pardon,\n    protested that he never read novels.",
  "Kitty stared at him, and Lydia\n    exclaimed.",
  "Other books were produced, and after some deliberation he\n    chose “Fordyce’s Sermons.”",
  "Lydia gaped as he opened the volume; and\n    before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she\n    interrupted him with,—",
  "“Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Philips talks of turning away\n    Richard?",
  "and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him.",
  "My aunt told me\n    so herself on Saturday.",
  "I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more\n    about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.”",
  "Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.\n    Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,—",
  "“I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books\n    of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit.",
  "It amazes\n    me, I confess; for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to\n    them as instruction.",
  "But I will no longer importune my young cousin.”",
  "Then, turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at\n    backgammon.",
  "Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted\n    very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.",
  "Mrs.\n    Bennet and her daughters apologized most civilly for Lydia’s\n    interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would\n    resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his\n    young cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any\n    affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared\n    for backgammon."
